    "#Multiprocessing is a programming paradigm that involves running multiple processes concurrently to achieve parallelism. \n",
    "#In multiprocessing, each process is a separate instance of the program that runs independently, has its own memory space,\n",
    "#and can execute tasks concurrently on separate CPU cores. This allows programs to take full advantage of modern multicore \n",
    "#processors and perform multiple tasks simultaneously, enhancing performance and throughput.\n",

    "#Question 2\n",
    "#Ans\n",
    "#Multiprocessing and multithreading are both techniques used to achieve concurrent execution in programs, \n",
    "#but they differ in how they manage and utilize resources to achieve parallelism.\n",
    "#MULTITHREADING VS MULTIPROCESSING:\n",
    "#<------------------------------------------>\n",
    "#1.  Processes vs. Threads:\n",
    "#Multiprocessing: \n",
    "#In multiprocessing, separate processes are created, each with its own memory space. Processes do not share memory by default, \n",
    "#which offers better isolation and reduces the chances of data corruption. Processes run independently and can achieve true parallelism by running \n",
    "#on separate CPU cores.\n",
    "#Multithreading:\n",
    "#In multithreading, multiple threads within a single process share the same memory space. Threads are lighter-weight than processes \n",
    "#and are managed by the operating system's thread scheduler. However, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python and similar limitations \n",
    "#in other languages, true parallelism might not be achieved for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "#<------------------------------------------>\n",
    "#2.Resource Allocation:\n",
    "#Multiprocessing: \n",
    "#Each process has its own resources, including memory space and variables. Resource allocation is not a concern, as each process operates independently.\n",
    "#Multithreading: \n",
    "#Threads within a process share the same memory space and variables. Resource sharing requires proper synchronization mechanisms to prevent race \n",
    "#conditions and data corruption.\n",
    "#<------------------------------------------>\n",
    "#3. Isolation:\n",
    "#Multiprocessing: \n",
    "#Processes are isolated from each other, which provides better protection against unintended side effects. However, \n",
    "#communication between processes requires inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms.\n",
    "#Multithreading: \n",
    "#Threads within the same process share memory and resources. While this can lead to easier communication, it also requires careful \n",
    "#synchronization to ensure data consistency.\n",
    "#<------------------------------------------>\n",
    "#4. GIL (Global Interpreter Lock):\n",
    "#Multiprocessing: \n",
    "#Processes run in separate memory spaces and are not affected by the GIL. This allows for true parallelism in Python.\n",
    "#Multithreading: \n",
    "#In Python, the GIL limits the ability of threads to execute Python bytecode in parallel, affecting performance for CPU-bound tasks. \n",

    "#<------------------------------------------>\n",
    "#5.  Performance:\n",
    "#Multiprocessing: \n",
    "#Multiprocessing is more suitable for CPU-bound tasks that require significant computational power and can achieve true parallelism.\n",
    "#Multithreading:\n",
    "#Multithreading is effective for I/O-bound tasks that spend a lot of time waiting for external resources like I/O operations to complete.\n",
